This branch runs the in person timbre validation

# During the Study Steps

1) I set the script up so it can automatically loop through by pressing enter, but i usually disable this feature and rerun the script each time. Its healthier for the arms

2) If you choose to do this, make sure to populate "time1" for stimuli 1 and time2 for stimuli 2

3) The times are designed so that the robot script should start when the audio is playing. I do this manually (i have 3 seconde buffer in logic where i press play then i press enter on the robot script when i hear sound
4 

4) I mute tracks in logic accordingly for the sutdy so make sure you have proper tracks muted

5) Logic also contains a chime sound for each stimuli to let the participant know when to hand the object to the robot

6) The following qualtrics is used for after the study: https://gatech.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_3Q6mflkoQQbgWIS
